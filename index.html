                When it comes to cleaning cars, Auto Dealers have been doing it the 
                same way for decades, ineffectively and at a greater cost than they 
                want. Meguiar’s Dealer Pro Series helps dealers create an efficient 
                process for cosmetic cleaning and correcting that reduces waste, saves 
                time, and makes cars look better.
                <br>
                <br>
                Dealer Pro Series understands how challenging it is to find qualified 
                technicians and management, and we’ve helped dozens of MSO's and OEM’s 
                to streamline detailing methods. When you use the right products, 
                with the right process, the performance of your technicians’ work 
                improves and creates consistency. When your cars are consistently 
                looking better, technicians are saving time per car, and your customers 
                are more satisfied, you save money and are in a position to begin 
                promoting the sale of specific cosmetic services to your customers in 
                the service lane. More money to the bottom line and more customers 
                returning to your store.

        <h2 class="contact-heading mb-4 mt-2" id="about-us">Company History</h2>
        <p>Dealer Pro Series was founded by Edwin Wooley, who after over 30 years 
            in the car business observed that the detailing department is almost 
            always a point of pain in dealerships. Ed’s ability to look toward 
            the future and see what is not yet a reality led to his partnership with 
            Meguiar’s and the development of the Dealer Pro Series Program.
